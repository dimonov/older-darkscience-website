				<h1>The DarkScience BBS</h1>
				<h2></h2>
				<p>The DarkScience BBS is a telnet BBS system running a customized EleBBS system. It has remained a part of our community since its birth. Just point your favorite telnet client to <a href="telnet://bbs.darkscience.ws">bbs.darkscience.ws</a> The BBS is also available via TOR hidden services at <a href='onion://opwg3dzxb4kczfbx.onion'>opwg3dzxb4kczfbx.onion</a>.</p>
				<br />
				<p>The BBS is driven with ANSI graphics, so you'll need a compliant telnet client to fully enjoy your experience. While calling, we stress that you visit the xternal program sections, which contains many multi-user DOOR Games and Utilities that most callers find enjoyable, as well as the Message Boards.</p>
