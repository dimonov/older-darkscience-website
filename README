The source tree
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This package is divided into the sections as follows:

	./*.php - files which contain the "glue" code used to interface
	with PunBB's database.

	./global.inc.php - the file which contains a lot of configurable
	options for the website.

	./includes/ - the directory of files which are included by the
	main website code.

	./template/ - the template directory.

	./ircd.motd - the old IRC message of the day.

	./oper_rules.txt - IRC operator rules.

Authors
~~~~~~~
PunBB was written by Rickard Andersson of punbb.org. The "glue" code, and
the includes were written almost entirely by fiftysixer, with minor
contributions from Goga[OEP], and a few more from dimonov (mostly security
fixes).
