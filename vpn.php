	<h1>The BadCypher DarkNet</h1>
	<h2></h2>
	<p>The BadCypher DarkNet ( A darknet may refer to any type of closed, private group of people communicating ) is a virtual private network (VPN) which is closed from outside communications, allowing for the DarkScience Network community to network with one another in a (more) private manner.</p>
	<br />
	<h1>How do I get connected?</h1>
	<h2></h2>
	<p>DarkScience offers entry into our darknet via public VPN accounts. We have provided pre-packaged configuration archives to get entry-level users started connecting with our VPN. The *nix configuration can be found <a href='/ds_client.tgz'>here</a> and the Windows configuration can be found <a href='/ds_client_win.tgz'>here</a>. Additionally, you will need the latest and greatest version of OpenVPN to go along with the config files. Please consult the documentation of your OpenVPN client for usage instructions, or get with us on IRC in #darkscience.</p>
